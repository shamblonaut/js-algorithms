# Exercises on Algorithms in JavaScript
Implementations of various algorithms in JavaScript

Some of these algorithms were made based on exercises provided by [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)

## Algorithms
The implemented algorithms are:
- [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence)
- [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
- [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)

## Run code
Ensure `node` (sometimes `nodejs` package) is installed on your system.

Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/shamblonaut/js-algorithms
```

Run any of the files (replace fileName.js with actual file names)
```sh
node fileName.js
```
**Note:** Some files may require additional arguments to be passed to them
